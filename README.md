# Hey! 👋

I'm Robin, an Econometrics & Economics student at Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Here are some cool projects I've been working on recently:

- Effortless NLP using pre-trained Hugging Face Pipelines, a blog-post on Medium
- [Money Printer Goes Brrr](Presentation.ipynb), a project on the intersection of sentiment analysis & finance for the [Turing Machine & Deep Learning](https://www.tstudents.nl/) course

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-van-merle/)!
