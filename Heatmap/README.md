# Heatmap

The main idea of this project is to make a heatmap out of gps data from my runs and bike rides. For this, I downloaded a number of .gpx files from Strava and visualised them with Python. The order in which I made the files is as follows:

1. [Initial exploration (gpx.ipynb)](https://nbviewer.org/github/RvMerle/RvMerle/blob/main/Heatmap/gpx.ipynb)
2. [Plotting multiple gpx files in a single figure and attempt of a heatmap (gpx_multiple.ipynb)](https://nbviewer.org/github/RvMerle/RvMerle/blob/main/Heatmap/gpx_multiple.ipynb)
3. [Animating the heatmap (gpx_animation.ipynb)](https://nbviewer.org/github/RvMerle/RvMerle/blob/main/Heatmap/gpx_animation.ipynb)
4. [Browser implementation of animated heatmap](gpx_animation.py)
